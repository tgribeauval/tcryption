1) Automate ASIC Miner Revenue / Profitability
- Monthly/Hourly Revenue varies on: TH/s (type of machine), Difficulty Levels
- Profitability varies on: Revenue and cost in electricity.

2) Automate Breakeven and Payback calculations
- Breakeven = True when Profit(Monthly) <= 0$.
- Payback (Nb of hours till investment paid back) = Price of machine/hourly profit.

3) Live Revenue Estimation:
Payout threshold at current BTC price divided by Estimated Payout Period.

4) Hosting Costs:
-Power x Cost per KW/s = hosting Costs
- If machine state is off, substract it's hosting cost from total hosting costs
-Total Power/Total cost per month/power per worker/cost per worker/worker status/down start time/up start time/total time off/cost per min/total cost per min
