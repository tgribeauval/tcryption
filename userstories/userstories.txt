1) Automate ASIC Miner Revenue / Profitability
- Monthly/Hourly Revenue varies on: TH/s (type of machine), Difficulty Levels
- Profitability varies on: Revenue and cost in electricity.

2) Automate Breakeven and Payback calculations
- Breakeven = True when Profit(Monthly) <= 0$.
- Payback (Nb of hours till investment paid back) = Price of machine/hourly profit.
